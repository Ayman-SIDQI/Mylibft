# Mylibft

Libft is a project at 42 School that requires you to create your own C library containing a subset of the standard C functions. This library will be used throughout the rest of the curriculum as a replacement for the standard library functions.

## Usage

To compile the library, run:

make

This will create a static library called libft.a. To use the library in your own programs, you can include the header file libft.h and link against the libft.a library.
Documentation

The documentation for each function can be found in the corresponding header file. For example, the documentation for the ft_memset function can be found in the libft.h header file.
Testing

A test suite for the library is included in the tests/ directory. To run the tests, first compile the library and then run:

make [test]

This will compile the test suite and run all the tests. If all the tests pass, you should see a message indicating that all the tests passed. If some of the tests fail, you should see a message indicating which tests failed and why.
